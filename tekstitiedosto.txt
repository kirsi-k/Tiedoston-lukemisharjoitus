The Our Lady of Good Voyage, also known as the Seaport Shrine, is a Roman Catholic church located at 51 Seaport Boulevard
in the Seaport District of Boston and in the Archdiocese of Boston. The shrine has 250 seats and holds Mass twice daily and
three times on Sundays. The original chapel was located a short distance away and was built to serve the fisherman and
dockworkers in what was then an industrial neighborhood.In 2017, a new church was constructed as part of a land swap deal
with a developer who wanted to build on the location of the original chapel. Today, the Seaport Shrine serves as an
apostolate of the Cathedral of the Holy Cross with a heavy focus on the young adults who live in the neighborhood.
